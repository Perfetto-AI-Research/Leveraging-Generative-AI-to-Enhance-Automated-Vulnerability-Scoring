<h1>Leveraging-Generative-AI-to-Enhance-Automated-Vulnerability-Scoring</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This repository contains the implementation and analysis related to the paper 
<strong>"Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Automated Vulnerability Scoring"</strong>, accepted at the 
<strong>22nd International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC 2024)</strong>.
Our paper introduces a novel machine learning model that utilizes <strong>Generative AI</strong> combined with a 
<strong>BERT-CNN architecture</strong> to improve the accuracy of vulnerability scoring by generating standardized descriptions and predicting CVSS vector metrics.
Through our experiments, we showcase significant accuracy improvements, providing an efficient, automated vulnerability assessment process.

<h2>Practical Guidelines: Proposed Model</h2>
<p>
This repository includes the proposed model along with state-of-the-art baselines used for comparison. Follow the steps below to execute the code:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Installation</strong>: Install and import the required libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, and Transformers.</li>
    <li><strong>Dataset Loading & Preprocessing</strong>: Load the <strong>NVD dataset</strong> and preprocess the vulnerability descriptions by cleaning the data (removing URLs, emails, etc.) and balancing the dataset. <a href="[NVD Dataset Link]">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f7N7TKneMGjznlw5oWdjhbArRrqHdU1W?usp=drive_link</a></li>
    <li><strong>Import Pre-trained Model</strong>: Load the pre-trained <strong>BERT</strong> model for tokenizing the text data.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine-tune BERT</strong>: Fine-tune the BERT model on the NVD dataset and save the trained model.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Definition</strong>: Load the <strong>FNT-BERT-CNN model</strong> and the baseline models (<em>Text_CNN_torch.ipynb</em>, <em>BERT_LSTM_TORCH.ipynb</em>, <em>BERT_LSTM_ATT_TORCH.ipynb</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training</strong>: Train the model using the training and validation datasets from the <strong>Original NVD Dataset</strong> 
        <a href="[Original Dataset Link]">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ht4zIOCyqoYHvfvy-4HXBX0BjQACqLiX?usp=drive_link</a> and the <strong>augmented dataset generated by ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo</strong> 
        <a href="[ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo Dataset Link]">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12cduxr-ezt4DhhdqTydOg_M_-uELtW8_?usp=drive_link</a>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: Evaluate the model on the test dataset to measure its performance and predict the CVSS vector metrics.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>
The repository includes a comprehensive analysis of vulnerability descriptions through semantic and performance evaluations.
You will find datasets from the <strong>National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</strong> to use in your analysis.
